        <p>
          My name is <strong>Rob Wierzbowski</strong>. I'm a web engineer that
          builds quality, resilient products, high functioning teams, and
          defines frontend direction for organizations with an emphasis on
          simplicity, modernity, and velocity over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing a much-enjoyed sabbatical, I'm happy to be joining
          <a class="content-link" href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> as a
          Staff engineer contributing to design systems and frontend platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I spent 5 years building a strong frontend universe at
          Stitch Fix and led teams through a period of accelerated growth at
          Casper.
        </p>

        <p>
          In real life, you'll find me loving the sun and hospitality in
          beautiful Austin, TX.
