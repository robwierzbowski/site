        <p>
          My name is <strong>Rob Wierzbowski</strong>. I'm a web engineer that
          builds quality, resilient products and teams, and defines frontend
          direction for organizations with an emphasis on simplicity, modernity,
          and the ways systems evolve over time.

            After completing a much-enjoyed sabbatical, I'm seeking a
            staff-level position at a company that wants to deliver industry
            leading experiences and multiply the effectiveness of their frontend
            teams. Learn&nbsp;more&nbsp;<a class="callout-link" href="/hire-me"

        </p>

        <p>
          I spent the last 5 years building a strong frontend universe at Stitch
          Fix. Previously, I helped deliver large projects and lead teams during
          a period of accelerated growth at Casper.
        </p>

        <p>
          In real life, you'll find me loving the sun and hospitality in
          beautiful Austin, TX.
