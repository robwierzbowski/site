  You might notice this file isn't minimized. Aside from inserting some HTML
  partials (using the tiny static site generator https://sergey.cool/), it's not
  processed in any way. I started writing code for the web in the late 90s, when
  viewing source was the main way we dove into the techniques and thought
  process of a person that built something we enjoyed. It was an exciting time
  of spelunking, discovery, and possibilities.

  Compilers and SPAs have taken the web amazing places, but on my site and my
  time I'd like to recapture some of that old wonder. No babel, no PostCSS, no
  minification. Just code and comments typed into an HTML file for anyone that
  cares to see.
