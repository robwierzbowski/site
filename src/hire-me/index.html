  You might notice this file isn't minimized. In fact, it's not processed in any
  way. I started writing code for the web in the late 90s, when viewing source
  was often the only way we had to dive into the minds of people who built
  something that made us ask "how!?". It was an exciting time of discovery,
  spelunking, and possibilities. In the years since, compilers and SPAs have
  taken the web amazing places, but on this site and with my time I'd like to
  recapture some of that old wonder. No build process, no dependencies, just
  code and comments typed into an HTML file for anyone that cares to look.

        I'm playing around with some font loading ideas. In almost all
        production settings FOUT is preferable, but here I'm preloading two
        small fonts in head and setting their font-display to block. This
        results in a calmer experience without FOUT or layout shifting but
        incurs a slight penalty to contentful paint metrics.

            Hi everyone. My name is Rob Wierzbowski, and I'm looking for my next
            role.
          </h1>

          <p>
            The basics: I'm an engineer and tech lead with 15+ years of
            experience. I help organizations multiply their effectiveness in
            both technology and process, with an emphasis on building high
            quality systems and creating the incentives necessary for long term
            velocity. I love working with collaborative and emotionally
            intelligent people on beautiful, usable products.
          </p>

          <p>
            This document describes what engages me, where I make the most
            impact, and the environment I thrive in. If we sound like a match,
            you can contact me at

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">The role</h3>

          <p>
            A Staff+ position responsible for defining and refining frontend
            practices. I prefer working on a platform or systems team, but I‚Äôm
            open to any role that solves broad problems in the frontend space.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Where</h3>

          <p>
            United States remote. I'd prefer to work with a team that's located
            primarily in North American time zones. I‚Äôm also open to partial
            remote in Austin, Texas.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">When</h3>

          <p>
            Interviewing now. Ideally I‚Äôd like to take a few weeks between hire
            and start to ensure I come into the role centered and rested.

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">What I bring</h3>

          <p>
            I shine when taking the long view, building tools and defining
            patterns that fold a well-reasoned tech strategy into the day-to-day
            work of engineering teams. View my

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">What you bring</h3>

          <p>
            You‚Äôre focused on refining and modernizing frontend systems and the
            ways your organization works together.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have a strong product and design organization. You value
            product, design, and engineering equally, and encourage them to work
            together as peers to solve problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            You work sustainably. You have the maturity to avoid crunches and
            overwork, and allow your employees the time off they need to
            maintain health and positivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have women and people of color in senior and leadership roles.
            The company I contribute to must look like the world I live in.
          </p>

          <p>
            You offer compensation and benefits at a competitive rate. Salary,
            401k, insurance, and time off are especially important to me,
            although total comp makes up for the sum of its parts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although not necessary, you‚Äôll move to the top of my list if you‚Äôre
            a larger company (500 to 5000 in the tech organization), are
            publicly traded or approaching IPO, or have established flex time
            for technical exploration.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Non-alignments</h3>

          <p>
            The following would make us a poor match. If you have these
            attributes it‚Äôs best to seek another candidate.
          </p>

          <p>
            You're a startup with less than 50 people in your tech organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            You're focused on military, government, blockchain, Web3, or EdTech
            products.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don‚Äôt staff frontend focused engineers, or respect, promote, and
            compensate them at the same rate as backend focused engineers. The
            frontend space is deep, and a staff of experts is required to build
            an industry leading product.
          </p>

          <p>
            You expect my role to be on call more than once every quarter,
            outside of business hours, or for products I do not have day-to-day
            responsibility for.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="subtitle">A note on interviews</h3>

          <p>
            The interview process is a reflection of company culture. I look for
            interviews that allow me to communicate my expertise in leadership,
            architecture, and technology. I love an interview where we talk
            about the organizational why and technical how of a feature set,
            pair on existing codebases, or use whiteboards and dialog to explore
            architecture and ways of working. Take home coding exercises where I
            can fully consider the requirements and edges of a prompt are also
            effective.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of the breadth of responsibilities at my level, Leetcode and
            speed focused exercises aren't an effective way to uncover what I
            bring to a company. If this is a step in your interview process I
            suggest we replace it with a deeper technical discussion or pairing
            exercise. I don't participate in technical interviews that are
            unrelated to the role (e.g., algorithm quizzes); these tend to be
            cultural and socioeconomic filters instead of an investigation of a
            candidate's pertinent skills, and are harmful to our profession.
