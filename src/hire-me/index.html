          Hi everyone. My name is Rob Wierzbowski, and I'm looking for my next
          role.
        </h1>

        <h3 class="subtitle">The basics</h3>

        <p>
          I'm an engineer with over a decade of experience in frontend
          technology and tech leadership. I help organizations build strong
          products and teams by focusing on quality, resilience, mentorship, and
          making the best way to do things the easiest way to do things. I love
          working with collaborative and emotionally intelligent people on
          beautiful, usable products.
        </p>

        <p>
          This post describes what engages me, where I make the most impact, and
          the environment I thrive in. If we sound like a match, you can contact
          me at

            >rob.wierzbowski@gmail.com</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">The role</h3>

        <p>
          A staff-level frontend engineering position on a platform or product
          team. Though I'm most interested in platform work, finding a team that
          shares a similar working style and definition of success, and one that
          provides an opportunity to make a positive, tangible impact, is more
          important to me than the specifics of what I'm working on.

            divops, design systems, developer experience, shared tools, large
            refactors, modernization, simplicity, success without ego, and
            cross-organization alignment.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Where</h3>

        <p>
          United States remote. I prefer to work with a team that's located in
          North American time zones. I‚Äôm also open to travel and partial
          in-office in Austin, Texas.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">When</h3>

        <p>
          Interviewing now. Ideally I‚Äôd like to take a week or two between hire
          and start to ensure I come into the role centered and rested.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">What I bring</h3>

        <p>
          I shine when taking the long view, building products, tools, and
          processes that fold a well-reasoned tech strategy into the day-to-day
          work of engineering teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see value in staying on the leading edge of the technologies we're
          using, but I'm not attracted to new for the sake of new. Practicality
          always trumps novelty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simplicity is a virtue. I spend the time to

            >make the letter shorter</a
          >, and strive to deliver code and documents that seem clear and
          obvious (although we may have traveled through complexity to get
          there).
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the most important part of a technical leadership position
          is communication, whether it be through well formed code,
          documentation, or presentations to peers and stakeholders.

        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">What you bring</h3>

        <p>
          You‚Äôre focused on refining and modernizing your frontend systems and
          the ways your organization works together.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have a strong product and design organization. You value product,
          design, and engineering equally, and encourage them to work together
          as peers to solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          You work sustainably. You have the maturity to avoid crunches and
          overwork, and allow your employees the time off they need to maintain
          health and positivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have women and people of color in senior and leadership roles. The
          company I work for has to look like the world I live in.
        </p>

        <p>
          You offer compensation and benefits at a competitive rate. Salary,
          401k match, insurance, and time off are especially important to me,
          although total comp makes up for the sum of its parts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although not necessary, you‚Äôll move to the top of my list if you‚Äôre a
          larger company (500 to 5000 in the tech organization) <em>or</em>
          if you're a smaller company looking for an person to set technical
          direction for the frontend staff. I'm also partial to companies that
          are publicly traded or approaching IPO, and ones that have perks that
          show they value employees as humans with life outside of work.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Non-alignments</h3>

        <p>
          The following could make us a poor match. If these describe you,
          another candidate may be a better fit.
        </p>

        <p>
          You're focused on military, government, blockchain, Web3, or EdTech
          products.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don‚Äôt value and staff frontend-focused engineers. The frontend
          space is deep, and a staff of experts is required to build an industry
          leading product.
        </p>

        <p>
          You expect my role to be on call more than once every quarter,
          especially for products I don't have day-to-day responsibility for.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">A note on interviews</h3>

        <p>
          The interview process is a reflection of company culture. I look for
          interviews that allow me to communicate my expertise in leadership,
          problem solving, and technology. I love an interview where we talk
          about the organizational why and technical how of a feature set, pair
          on existing codebases, or use whiteboards and conversation to explore
          architecture and ways of working. Take home coding exercises where I
          can fully consider the requirements and edges of a prompt are
          especially effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of the breadth of responsibilities I've had over the past few
          years, Leetcode and speed focused exercises aren't an effective way
          for me to display what I bring to a company. If this is a step in your
          interview process I propose we replace it with a pairing or take home
          exercise where I can communicate the whys as well as hows, and deliver
          more realistic code than a rushed first draft. As a rule, I don't
          participate in technical interviews that are unrelated to the role
          (e.g., algorithm quizzes); these tend to be cultural and socioeconomic
          filters instead of a test of a candidate's relevant skills, and are
          harmful to our profession.
        </p>
